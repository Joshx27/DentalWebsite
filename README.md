The clinic, which employs five dentists, five dental technicians, four hygienists, and six office staff workers,offers a full line of dental services. DTC Dental currently has a customer base of 2,500 patients from 900 different households. John Roberts, the owner of DTC Dental, has hired your team to build an initial version of the DTC Dental web application. This version of the DTC Dental website will not be customer facing. It will be used internally by DTC employees to schedule patients, record patient visits, and manage patient records. A DTC employee will use the application to schedule patient appointments (including add, edit, and delete appointment functionality). After a patient visits DTC and receives treatment, an employee will record the services provided during the visit.
